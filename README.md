# 👋 Hey, I’m Ankur

**Full-stack engineer who breaks things only to rebuild them better.**
I build scalable systems, ship real products, and keep the vibes clean ✨.

## ⚡ What I Do

I enjoy turning messy ideas into **production-grade systems** — the kind that quietly run at 3AM while everyone is asleep.

* TypeScript everywhere (frontend, backend, CLI tools)
* Distributed systems, queues, workflow engines
* Telehealth & FinTech product engineering
* DevOps when needed (K8s, Redis, Postgres, Mongo, MinIO)
* Small teams → fast shipping → fewer meetings → better products
